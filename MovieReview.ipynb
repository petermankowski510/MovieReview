      "Review: years ago when darling played on tv it was always the pan and version which i hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format so when i saw an dvd of this julie andrews blake i decided to purchase and watch it once and for all br br boy what a terrible film it's so bad and on so many levels that i really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong looking at it now it's obvious to any fans of movies that blake created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with andrews in musicals mary sound of music thoroughly modern etc but also because andrews was from starring in projects made famous on stage by julie herself my fair lady etc because hollywood thought she wasn't sexy or glamorous enough so blake created this effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre of spy story war movie romance slapstick comedy musical darling suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesn't work at all to a point of it being very embarrassing br br mind you the version on the dvd is the director's cut or in this case let's salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop in releasing the dvd cut 19 scenes 19 from the original theatrical version into this more and yet remarkably version the film moves along with no idea of what it is we are 25 minutes into it and we still don't know what's going on or why we're watching what's going what kind of spy is how powerful is she was she ever responsible for someone's death instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking rock hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking julie andrews things aren't helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love why does julie fall for hudson why him and not other men she got involved with there should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to her secret this would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action it would also have given us some to the proceedings there's no in this story br br one only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by and previous the best or worst example is the scene when andrews and hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest sound of music it's no wonder he removed it from the dvd back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment of desperation there are other plot elements directly inspired by andrews other films the endless scenes of is inspired by the much better modern the musical moment i'll give you three was created just to make fun of mary persona which is turned raunchy with julie doing a in the act the ending eye view of julie running towards plane is another at sound of music br br the whole thing is confusing julie plays a singer born from a german father and british mother who lives in england but sings her english songs in paris you never know exactly where the story takes place some moments are just badly edited like when julie and her uncle are on they talk and talk and then julie suddenly off in mid sentence i'm like what happened here br br the comedy bits are unfunny and cringe worthy every scene with the french police are pathetic where's peter sellers when you really need him the action is stupid beyond belief when julie and her uncle are on their way to germany on that train shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing in the process brilliant what's also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but hudson and his reach the train even though they fly off the next morning that's one slow moving train there br br the musical moments the beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason i gave this film 3 stars but it's effect is considerably because it's repeated at the end speaking of redundant did we really need to see a can can dance scene and julie too the girl in no man's land is ok even if it's bleeding obvious but that moment just doesn't make any sense whatsoever because sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a french hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured by the result of her br br the whole project is and without energy the romance is 100 unbelievable rock hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene julie looks like she's on but what really kills this ill conceived project is julie playing a german spy desperately wanted to the mary syndrome his wife and believed that playing a was a good career decision as much as i like julie she's no greta garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in funny enough even if julie plays a german spy she still comes across as and cute br br how bad is darling even after years since its release blake felt he still needed to work on it for its dvd release\n",
